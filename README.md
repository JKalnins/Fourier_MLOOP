# Fourier_MLOOP
 Streamlining Module for running M-LOOP optimising Fourier Series and saving results.
 
 Developed as part of my Masters Project working with Gaussian Processes to optimise physics experiments.
 
 If you want to install this, please ensure you have M-LOOP (https://m-loop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/mloop.html) installed in a virtual env/conda env first, since package management is probably not implemented properly (and M-LOOP's dependencies can be fiddly to install). Clone this repo to a local directory, enter the directory and activate the env with M-LOOP installed, then install with `pip install .`.
 
 Code style is managed with Black.
